## Collaboration {-}

Please indicate who you collaborated with on this problem set: 


## Background {-}

In this problem set we will use a small **sample** of data from the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/). The survey is designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes. You will work with a **sample** from one neighborhood. The full neighborhood of **ALL individuals** is the population. For this problem set we do **not** know the **true population parameters** for any of the variables, because we do not have data on every person in the neighborhood. 

## Setup

First load the necessary packages 


```{r message=FALSE}
# Recall that loading the tidyverse "umbrella" package loads ggplot2, dplyr, and
# readr all at once. Feel free to load these packages any way you choose.
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

Next load the data set, from where it is stored on the web: 

```{r, message = FALSE}
gss_sample <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSypSoDCMH2N76Vo2dZRPkw2q3t1mbvAXlOtgPDIsHg4NclAQFmER-BdvXH9_lrT40UQCVdPXOi_NMJ/pub?gid=257689625&single=true&output=csv")
```

Be sure to take a look at the data in the **viewer**. Each row in the data set is a person that was surveyed (100 rows or cases in total). The variables in the data set include each respondent's `age`,  `race`, and number of hours of TV watched a day `tvhours`. 




**Setting a seed:** We will take some random samples and build sampling distributions in this lab. In order to make sure R takes the same random sample every time you run your code, you can do what is called "setting a seed". Do this in any code chunk that you take a random sample! 

You can set a seed like so. Any number will do. (You do not need to run this right now...just showing you how)
```{r}
set.seed(45)
```







# Confidence intervals from a bootstrap resample

### Step 1: Take 1000 bootstrap resamples

The following code tells R to take 1000 bootstrap resamples from the `gss_sample` data. You can set the seed to whatever value you like! 

```{r}
set.seed(42)

boot_samp_1000 <- gss_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 1000, replace = TRUE)
```

Note a few important details about the `rep_sample_n` function, and bootstrap sampling in general:

* `size = 100` tells R that each bootstrap resample we take has 100 cases... the size of the original sample
* `reps = 1000` tells R to take 1000 bootstrap resamples (each of size 100).
* The `replace = TRUE` argument tells R that in each bootstrap resample, we can include a row from `gss_sample` multiple times. So if for instance, respondent # 12 is the first random resample taken here, respondent 12 is still available to be resampled **again** at random. Thus, some people may appear **multiple times** in our bootstrap resample, and some people from the original data set may not appear at all. 
* We save the results in a data frame `boot_samp_1000`. 





Take a look at the `boot_samp_1000` data frame we just generated in RStudio's data viewer. Note that the `replicate` column labels each bootstrap resample (the first 100 rows are labeled 1, the next 100 rows are labeled 2, etc.)

# Question 1

How many rows does `boot_samp_1000` have? **Why?** 

**Answer: 100,000. Because we took 1000 samples of 100 cases each, which is 100,000  = One hundred thousand.**





### Step 2: Calculate the bootstrap statistic

Let's say we want to use the bootstrap resample that we just generated to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean $\mu_{tv}$ of `tvhours`. To do so, we need to know the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of `tvhours` **for each of the 1000 bootstrap resamples**. In this case, the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of `tvhours` for **each bootstrap resample** is our **BOOTSTRAP STATISTIC**.  We can calculate that with two lines of code, like so: 

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(boot_stat = mean(tvhours))
```

Note that:

- The `group_by()` argument tells R to take the sample mean of `tvhours` **separately** for each different `replicate` in the bootstrap resample. 
- We put the sample mean for each bootstrap resample in a column called `boot_stat`




> This is the bootstrap distribution for the mean of `tvhours`! 





Take a look at the `boot_distrib_tv` we just created in RStudio's data viewer. 

# Question 2

How many values of the bootstrap statistic `boot_stat` are there?  Please explain **why** there are this many values of the bootstrap statistic. 

**Answer: there are 1000 boot_stat values, because we took 1000 bootstrap resamples, and calculated the sample mean for each sample. This equates to 1000 bootstrap statistics**.





### Visualizing the bootstrap distribution  

The bootstrap distribution is shown in the figure below. This is a histogram of the `boot_stat` values from `boot_distrib_tv`. 

```{r echo=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = boot_distrib_tv, aes(x = boot_stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 0.25) + 
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution", 
       x = "boostrap statistic (mean tvhours)")
```

### Step 3: CI from a bootstrap resample 

### a) CI using the 95% rule 

We can now use the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean `tvhours` $\bar{x}$ to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$, using the "95% rule for bell shaped distributions", which states that the middle 95% of values of a bell/normal shaped distribution are between

$$\text{mean} \pm 1.96 \cdot SD$$

* the mean here would be the mean of the bootstrap distribution 
* the SD here is the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution, which recall has a special name: the **standard error**.

We can thus apply the 95% rule, like so: 

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```



### b) CI using percentile method

You can also calculate a 95% confidence interval using the percentile method. The logic goes like this: 

Since our bootstrap resample had 1000 values of `boot_stat`:

1. 950 of the `boot_stat` values fall **inside** this 95% confidence interval, i.e. 95%
1. 25 values fall **below** it. i.e. the lower 2.5%
1. 25 values fall **above** it. i.e. the higher 2.5%

totaling 100%. We can use **the quantiles** of the bootstrap distribution to find these values like so:

```{r}
prct_ci_tv <- boot_distrib_tv %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))

prct_ci_tv
```

This method 

* Asks R to identify the 0.025 quantile of the bootstrap sample means... this is the value **below** which **2.5% of the values of `boot_stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example... 25/1000 = 0.025)
* Asks R to identify the 0.975 quantile for the bootstrap sample means... this is the value **above** which the other **2.5% of the values of `boot_stat`** fall (or 25 cases in this example  975/1000 = 0.975)
* The middle 95% of the values fall between these two quantiles

Based on these results, we are 95% confident that the **true mean hours of TV watched $\mu_{tv}$ in the population** is between the upper and lower CI we just calculated. 

### Visualizing the Confidence interval 

The bootstrap distribution and the 95% confidence intervals we just calculated are shown in the figure below. This is a histogram of the `boot_stat` values from `boot_distrib_tv`. The green line is the lower bound of the 95% CI, and the blue line is the upper bound. 950 of the 1000 bootstrap resamples had a mean for `tvhours` that fell **between** the green and blue lines...25 of the samples had a mean above the blue line, and 25 of the samples had a mean below the green line. 

```{r echo=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = boot_distrib_tv, aes(x = boot_stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 0.25) + 
  labs(title = "Bootstrap distribution with 95% CI", 
       x = "boostrap statistic (mean tvhours)") +
  geom_vline(data = prct_ci_tv, aes(xintercept = lower_ci), color = "green", lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(data = prct_ci_tv, aes(xintercept = upper_ci), color = "blue", lwd = 2) 
```





# Question 3

**If** we calculated a **90% confidence interval** for the mean of `tvhours` using this same bootstrap resample and the percentile method, roughly how many of the 1000 values of `tv_mean` would fall between the green and blue lines?

**Answer: 900**


# Question 4 

Use the bootstrap resampling distribution for `tvhours` generated above (`boot_distrib_tv`)  and the **percentile** method to calculate a 99% confidence interval for the mean `tvhours`.

```{r}
boot_distrib_tv %>%  
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.005), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.995))

```






# Question 5

Which confidence interval is **WIDER**: the 95% confidence interval or the 99% confidence interval for the population mean `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$? Why?

**Answer: Conceptually, the 99% CI is wider, because we are casting a wider net. Also, more of the boot_stat values are included in a 99% CI (990) as compared to a 95% CI (950)** 





# Question 6a

Use the bootstrap resample we generated above (`boot_samp_1000`), to generate a **bootstrap distribution** for the sample mean respondent `age` $\bar{x}$ instead of `tvhours`. Please be sure to **name it something different** than the bootstrap distribution for the sample mean of `tvhours`

```{r}
boot_distb_age <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(boot_stat = mean(age)) 
```


# Question 6b 

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean respondent `age` $\mu_{age}$ using the **95% rule** method. 

```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se))
```


# Question 6c

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean respondent `age` $\mu_{age}$ using the **percentile** method. 

```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))
```
    
    
# Question 6d

How do the 95% confidence intervals you calculated in 6b and 6c compare? i.e. are the 95% CI values similar or are they pretty different?


**Answer: they are very similar!** 





# Question 7

Use the **bootstrap resampling distribution** for the sample mean respondent `age` and the percentile method to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the population mean respondent age $\mu_{age}$.

```{r}
boot_distb_age %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.1), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.9))
```






# Bootstrap sampling distribution & confidence intervals with categorical variables

The procedure for generating a bootstrap sampling distribution is VERY similar for categorical data. As an example we will generate a bootstrap sampling distribution for the proportion of respondents that identified as a Person of Color. 

### Step 1: Take 1000 bootstrap resamples

We already did this above! We can use the same `boot_samp_1000` as before. 

### Step2:  Calculate the bootstrap statistic $\hat{p}$

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            POC_count = sum(race == "POC"), 
            boot_stat = POC_count/n)
```

Note that with a categorical variable, the code differs in two important respects now:  

* the population parameter that we don't know, but are inferring about via sampling, is now the population proportion $p$ that identify as a POC. 
* the sample statistic AKA point estimate that we calculate with the summarize command is now the **sample proportion** $\widehat{p}$ rather than a sample mean $\bar{x}$
* To get our proportion $\widehat{p}$ of **ONE** of the race categories (POC), we need to **first** calculate the total sample size for each replicate and the count of how many cases are `race == "POC"` in each replicate.

### Step 3: Generate the 95% Confidence Interval

### a) CI using the 95% rule 

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as `POC` using the 95% rule. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```


### b) CI with the percentile method 

The following will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people that identified as "POC" using the percentile method. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_POC %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))
```


# Question 8 

Calculate a 95% CI for the **population proportion** of respondents $p$ that identified as **White** using EITHER the percentile or 95% rule method. Note that you will first need to generate the bootstrap distribution for the proportion of respondents that identified as `White`. 

```{r}
boot_distrib_wh <- boot_samp_1000 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            wh_count = sum(race == "White"), 
            boot_stat = wh_count/n)
```


```{r}
# 95% rule
boot_distrib_wh %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(boot_stat), 
            se = sd(boot_stat), 
            lower_ci = mean - (1.96 * se), 
            upper_ci = mean + (1.96 * se))
```

```{r}
# percentile
boot_distrib_wh %>% 
  summarize(lower_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.025), 
            upper_ci = quantile(boot_stat, 0.975))
```






# Confidence intervals based on the theoretical normal distribution  

As described in [moderndive chapter 8.7.2](https://moderndive-bert.netlify.com/8-confidence-intervals.html#theory-ci), not only can we generate confidence intervals using a computer/resampling as we've been doing until now, in many cases there also exists a mathematical formula! This however necessitates a little mathematical/probability theory; a topic we leave to a more advanced statistics class.

To generate a 95% confidence interval based on the theoretical normal distribution, we can use the following formula: 

$$ \text{point estimate} \pm 1.96 \cdot \widehat{SE}$$

So, for instance if we wanted to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$ that respondents watched based on our sample: 

* the **point estimate** AKA **sample statistic** in this case would be the sample mean number of `tvhours` from the sample: $\bar{x}$
* We would estimate the standard error using the formula

$$\widehat{SE} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where $s$ is the **sample standard deviation**, which is a point estimate of the **population standard deviation** $\sigma$.


Thus a 95% CI would be

$$
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot \widehat{SE} =  \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

We can make these calculations in R like so: 

```{r}
gss_sample %>% 
  summarize(x_bar = mean(tvhours), 
            sd = sd(tvhours), 
            n = n(), 
            se = sd/sqrt(n), 
            lower_ci = x_bar - 1.96 * se, 
            upper_ci = x_bar + 1.96 * se)
```


# Question 9 

Write down the three 95% confidence intervals for the population mean of `tvhours` $\mu_{tv}$ you've computed in this problem set. Do this by replacing
X, Y, A, B, P, and Q with the appropriate values you've computed. 

When you are done, make sure all the `|` in the table still line up so your results print out in a table!
