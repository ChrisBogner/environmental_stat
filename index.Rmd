# Preface {-}

> The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' 
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Isaac Asimov')`


In this course, we will use the following tools:


**ILIAS**: the moodle platform at the UoC. You should all be registered there already.


**Campuswire**: a chat platform to decrease the number of emails and allow for a more natural exchange between participants and lecturer. You should have received an invitation email, if not, email me, please.


## Intended learning outcomes (ILOs) {-}
At the end of this course you should be able to

```{block, type='rmdoutcomes'}
- Import/read data into R.
- Prepare data for analysis.
- Visualize data.
- Explain and apply statistical methods learnt in this course.
- Combine code and report in a reproducible way.
- Apply selected methods learnt in this course to a new data set and write a reproducible report.
```


## Literature {-}
We will be using the book [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/) [@ModernDive] mainly. Additionally, I will recommend from time to time [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@r4ds] and [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) [@Diez2019]. For your report, you will do an additional literature search depending on your topic.


## Why these lecture notes {-}

This document is a working and live document that will be updated during the course. It is not comprehensive, but should help you to navigate through the introduction to R and statistics smoothly.

I will use different colour boxes

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
Infos and tips
```



```{block, type='rmdoutcomes'}
Learning outcomes
```


```{block, type='rmdalert'}
This is important
```


```{block, type='rmddef'}
This is a definition
```


```{block, type='exercises'}
1. This is an exercise inside a chapter.
```


<!-- <br> -->

<!-- ```{block, type='rmdsummary'} -->
<!-- Zusammenfassung -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Reproducibility {-}
This book was written in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) and compiled in `r R.version.string`. You will need the following packages to reproduce the examples and to work through the exercises:

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
# code from ggplot2 book
# https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/introduction.Rmd
    deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
    pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
    pkgs2 <- strwrap(paste(encodeString(pkgs, quote = '"'), collapse = ", "), exdent = 2)
    install <- paste0(
      "install.packages(c(\n  ", 
      paste(pkgs2, "\n", collapse = ""), 
      "))"
    )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
# code from ggplot2 book
# https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/introduction.Rmd
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```

The complete information on the last session to build the book:

```{r, echo = FALSE,}
sessionInfo()
```
