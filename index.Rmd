# Preface {-}

> The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...' 
`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Isaac Asimov')`

## Online teaching {-}

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
The corona virus pandemic impacts our lives and changes the way we teach and learn. This course will be held online. Please be patient if not all activities turn out to be successful and not all technical tools function as desired. We all will do our best to support you in your curriculum.
```

In this course, we will use the following tools:


**ILIAS**: the moodle platform at the UoC. You should all be registered there already.


**Campuswire**: a chat platform to decrease the number of emails and allow for a more natural exchange between participants and lecturer. You should have received an invitation email, if not, send me an email, please.


**Zoom**: will be used for live presentations. Please check the registration requirements on ILIAS.


**RStudio Server Pro**: a server with a running R and RStudio installation. We will be working there.

## Intended learning outcomes (ILOs) {-}
At the end of this course you should be able to

```{block, type='rmdoutcomes'}
- Write simple R scripts for data analysis.
- Explain statistical methods learnt in this course.
- Apply statistical methods learnt in this course.
- Apply selected methods to a new data set and write a report.
```


## Literature {-}
We will be using the book [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/) [@ModernDive] mainly. Additionally, I will recommend from time to time [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@r4ds] and [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) [@Diez2019]. For your report, you will do an additional literature search depending on your topic.


## Why these lecture notes {-}

This document is a working and live document that will be updated during the course. It is not comprehensive, but should help you to navigate through the introduction to R and statistics smoothly.

I will use different colour boxes

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
Infos and tips
```



```{block, type='rmdoutcomes'}
Learning outcomes
```


```{block, type='rmdalert'}
This is important
```


```{block, type='exercises'}
1. This is an exercise inside a chapter.
```

## Reproducibility {-}
This book was written in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) and compiled in `r R.version.string`. You will need the following packages to reproduce the examples and to work through the exercises:

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
# code from ggplot2 book
# https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/introduction.Rmd
    deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
    pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
    pkgs2 <- strwrap(paste(encodeString(pkgs, quote = '"'), collapse = ", "), exdent = 2)
    install <- paste0(
      "install.packages(c(\n  ", 
      paste(pkgs2, "\n", collapse = ""), 
      "))"
    )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
# code from ggplot2 book
# https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/introduction.Rmd
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```

The complete information on the last session to build the book:

```{r, echo = FALSE,}
sessionInfo()
```
